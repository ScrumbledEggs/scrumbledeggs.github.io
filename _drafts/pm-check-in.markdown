Coming off of Sprint 3, I wanted to discuss my experience of serving as the "PM" for the sprint. Starting off on Sunday the 19th (after recapping Sprint 2 as a team), most of my goals revolved around using our time in class as a team effectively. Classtime was generally the only time we all met as a group to work on the project other than prepping the night before for sprint reviews. This meant that we ended up trying to have design discussions, individual work, integration, and check-ins all at the same time. While we had set up a standup bot with Slack, we didn't discuss those results in class. At the end of classtime, we were working on our individual contributions and didn't check in on next steps.
