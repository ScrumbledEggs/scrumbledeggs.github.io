With only 9 days left before the demo, we are going strong.

We have reached our MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and will focus on improving robustness in the software, to make it clean and reliable on demo day. We also have over $160 of the budget remaining, so we decided to buy parts for a second BoardBot, and document the build process in minute detail. Finally, we all want to make a compelling and funny promotional video for demo day.
