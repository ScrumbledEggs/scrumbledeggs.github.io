# Mos important advice:
Write posts into \_drafts. Do it and we'll all be happy.

# What to write there:
What decisions have you made up to now?
What's the current status of the subteam?
How does someone tool up to do more work?
What is the next step to work on?


## Decisions:
Using jekyll and hosting on scrumbledeggs.github.io
hold off styling in favor of structure
Blocker: Where to go next without consulting with team

## Current status:
Website exists, needs text and image content.
Needs backfilling
Needs forward pushing

## Tooling:
Website info is held on scrumbledeggs.github.io
Compiled with jekyll
File structure:
```
drafts - not built automatically
posts - blog posts built automatically
sprints - collection for sprint overviews
```

elements.md holds examples of all of the elements that the theme has


To transfer to linwebprod: copy the (built) static website to the linwebprod folder



## Things to work on:
Current images need to be fixed: scaled and centered w/ sass
Add images
Upload videos
Pester others to document their work and decisions
Be better at having documentation be an Important Thing
Add authors on Jekyll, make their image and name autofill in signature
