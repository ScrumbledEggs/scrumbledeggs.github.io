Our mechanical design is [available on Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/8f08652983ca17f06e9ac67d/w/e174f06e8eb73e105045d519/e/7b27395932c9fa97ee45a030). Our software is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ScrumbledEggs/PoE).

# Steps:
Laser cut the stepper hooks, end effector assembly, and arduino mount out of your material of choice. We used clear 1/8" Acrylic and are very happy with the results.
