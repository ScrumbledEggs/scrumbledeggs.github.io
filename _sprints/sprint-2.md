## What we did in Sprint 2:
* Integrated stepper motors
* Started processing SVGs
* Made lower-quality drawings because of the stepper driver and library
  *  Adafruit stepper driver communicates over I2C, so it is slow for 1000s of steps
* Made end-effector with move and draw (not erase)
* Started working on this website

## Design:
* Keeping constant pressure on pen
  * Important for smooth lines

## Future Risks:
* Wireless communications to end effector
  * Or better cable management 


QUALITY!
