As this was the first sprint for the project, we had to set up our workspace (both physically and virtually), work through  and get a first-pass prototype together in 2 weeks.

### Individual Learning Goals
- Jared: How to be professional and productive working with friends.
- Alex: Get better at Mechanical Design and feel accomplished.
- Ian: Do something fun. Also embedded software.
- Evan: Working with a focus on PM and documentation
- Adam: Learn the process (toolchains / PM skills / documentation)

### Goals for this sprint
- A simple two DC motor system that draws on a board
- Control by setting a list of preprogrammed xy positions
- Have all team communications and systems set up
- Have control-system math for equations of motion
- Have a productivity setup consisting of Trello, Git, Slack and Google Drive

### Identified Risks
1. Keeping constant pressure while moving  
  _Important for good looking lines_
2. Actuating the draw/erase/neither mechanism  
  _Important for full functionality_
3. Capturing Vector graphics  
  _Important for end-to-end use case_
4. Positioning without drift  
  _Important for accurate drawings_

### Goals for the next sprint
- Use stepper motors
- Better cable/string system
- Actuated pen and eraser tools
- Vector graphics from computer
