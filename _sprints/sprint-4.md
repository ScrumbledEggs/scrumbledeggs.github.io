## Reframing in terms of final goals
Going into this final sprint we all had some different goals this orginally were:
* Creation of a second Boardbot with a documented build
* Clean CLI interface(allows for anyone to use an SVG file)
* Well documented website
* Polished product
* Cross whiteboard mounting
These were then whittled down to the oens that we saw as both reasonable and important:
* Well documented website
* Creation of a second Boardbot with a documented build
* Polished product 
* Limited ability to cross whiteboard mount

The work for this sprint can be seen on our DIY page(insert link).

## Risks:
* Multiple Divergent Goals Overscoping
* Serial port issues
